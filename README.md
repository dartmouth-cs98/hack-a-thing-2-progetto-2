## Description
Built a simple meal storage app called FoodTracker. This app shows a list of meals with their names, photos, and ratings. A user can choose to add, remove, or edit a meal. To add a new meal or edit an existing one, users navigate to a different view where they can select a name, photo, and rating for a specific meal. To delete a meal, you can either click edit and select the meal to delete, or simply swipe left to delete.
## Learnings
Having no familiarity with Swift and Xcode, learned how to code in Swift and use Xcode. Specifically:
- learned to work with view controllers
- learned to implement a custom control
- learned to implement a custom data model
- learned to create a table view
- learned to implement navigation
- learned to implement add/edit/delete
- learned to implement data persistency
## Inspirations
Inspires me to continue working on mobile applications, hopefully in the VR and social spaces.
